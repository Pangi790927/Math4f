The matrix will be constructed as follows: 
-> we will consider basic types to be a matrix of 1 X 1
-> we will take the first matrix and place it at (0, 0)
-> if the second matrix has space on the right of the first matrix then we place it on the right
-> else we jump on the line under the matrix we just placed at collumn 0 and 
continue placing the next matrix from there
